_ubiqx_ Modules
===============

Simple tools you should never need to write yourself (except maybe for a
Computer Science class).

* Linked Lists (Single and Double)
* Binary Trees (Simple, AVL, and Splay)

These modules have been around for a while.  They were originally written in
the late 1980's/early 1990's for use on the Amiga platform.  They work just
fine on Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and probably many others.  They are fairly
self-contained, so the port to new platforms with relative ease.

Using the _ubiqx_ Modules
-------------------------

These modules rely on a simple quirk of the C language.  The specification
states that the address of a structure is the same as the address of its first
member.^[ANSI-C, pg.174]^
